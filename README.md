# FAQ

This is a collection of common questions I receive, hopefully with some good answers.

## 2D Creative Coding

### 2d Canvas API

This is an amazing web API, and I highly recommend it.
 * [CanvasRenderingContext2D - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
 * [How to Draw Beautiful Things in the Browser](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/10/how-to-draw-beautiful-things-in-the-browser/)

### PixiJS

Want to leverage WebGL, with a nice 2d API. I recommend [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/). It has a really nice API and great docs. It's actively supported and a mature product.

### Phaser

Want to make 2d games? [Phaser has everything you need](http://phaser.io/). Under the hood it's powered by Pixi.js, but it includes things like physics systems, a full fledged game engine, and great docs. I also recommend checking out [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/).

## 3D Creative Coding

### three.js

If you want to get started doing 3d, then I highly recommend learning by using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Start by reading the source of the [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/). I helped out in the early days with documentation, and reading the source code of how three.js works was a nice way to learn 3d for me.

### regl

I leave my preferred WebGL library for the end. I don't recommend starting out with it, but once you've graduated to knowing more about how WebGL works, it's a great library to do things from scratch. It makes it fun to work with the WebGL API. It's what I've used to build all of my [Sessions](http://github.com/gregtatum/sessions).

### Learning WebGL

Going from three.js which is a great abstraction, to knowing raw WebGL is a big leap. I'd recommend if you want to do this, try first by rendering a lit [bunny rabbit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunny) from scratch. The following are a list of resources I've used to help on my path.

 * [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) - The first stop on your path to learning WebGL
 * [WebGL on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) - Lots of docs here.
 * [WebGL Spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/) - If you really want to learn it, read the spec. Seriously.
 * [My YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/tatumcreative) - I've talked a lot about my process on how I make things here.
 * [Matrix math for the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Matrix_math_for_the_web)
 * [Game Engine Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Architecture-Jason-Gregory/dp/1568814135) - One of the best damn books. It's a deep dive for sure.
 * [Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Programming-Computer-Graphics-Third/dp/1435458869/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523370446&sr=1-2&keywords=math+for+game+programming) - Math is your friend.
 * [GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_pref01.html) - Craaazy techniques
 * [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Third-Tomas-Akenine-Moller/dp/1568814240/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523370513&sr=1-3&keywords=realtime+rendering&dpID=513BJHDPkjL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) - Craaaazy math.
